In 1936, their three kids started doing shows as “The Three Little Hillbillies.”</p><p>They moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1938, where their children started working as extras in movies. Blake had a hard childhood. His alcoholic father beat him up a lot. When he was ten and started public school, he was picked on and got into fights with other kids, which got him kicked out.</p><p>Blake said that when he was a child, his parents hurt him physically and sexually and often locked him in a closet and made him eat off the floor as punishment.
