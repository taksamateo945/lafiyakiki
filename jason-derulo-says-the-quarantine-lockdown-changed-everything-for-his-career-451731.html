The 31-year-old said in a new interview with new! magazine that in 2019, he spent just 60 days at home, so in many ways, his extended time at home has forced him to reflect on his career.</p><p>Most of the entertainment industry has been shuttered as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with many production companies shutting down and concerts facing outright bans, including some of the biggest events like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coachella.</a></p><p>According to new! magazine, the COVID-19 pandemic has led him to re-think how he handles his career. The star told the outlet that he can’t see himself “going on the road again” as much as he used to, simply because he has had so much fun this year.</p><p>Derulo claims he’ll continue to tour around the world to support his career, but he’ll also focus on his time at home as well. Regarding his rise to superstardom, Jason says having a career in the music industry isn’t that easy.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CG-hhXlBElD/</p><p>Derulo says that if he was asked to give someone advice who wanted to break into the industry, he would say not to do it because it takes so much of a person’s “heart and soul.” Jason went on to say that like everything else in life, there are a lot of people chasing after the top position.</p><p>For that reason, having a great work ethic is going to make all the difference. The performer says musicians who want to make it have to “want it more than anybody else.”</p><p>The performing artist went on to say that a musician has to “live, eat, breathe, and sleep” their craft. Jason says that while it’s challenging at times, there are a lot of parts of it that are easy, however.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Fans of Jason know he has also fostered a massive following on TikTok as well for his regular videos. For instance, the singer-songwriter was in the headlines when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he ate so many hamburgers that he had to throw up.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGealsCwuoydnKutnKR6tK3YrGStoJVivrat0ZqlraGemnqtu8Kkm6ivnmKwqa3NoJydZZWrsrPF06Ggp59dm7yzeceiqmabkaeypr6MbWxqb2NmfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./simon-cowell-will-reportedly-lay-in-bed-for-the-next-6-months-following-his-neck-injury-444693.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Simon Cowell Will Reportedly Lay In Bed For The Next 6 Months Following His Neck Injury</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./halo-master-chief-collection-xbox-one.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Halo: The Master Chief Collection brings four Halo games to Xbox One Nov. 11</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./day-life-pretty-little-liars-fan.html>A Day In The Life of a Pretty Little Liars fan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./thomas-joseph-big-heads-4-letters-crossword-clue-answers-1236577.html>Thomas Joseph Big heads 4 letters Crossword Clue Answers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities.html>Dina Manzo News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-hudgens-nude-picture-scandal-was-the-worst-moment-of-my-career-2013202.html>Vanessa Hudgens: Nude Picture Scandal Was the &amp;quot;Worst Moment of My Career&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-bogs-crossword-clue-answers-with-5-letters-1273267.html>LA Times Bogs Crossword Clue Answers with 5 letters</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZedJ.
