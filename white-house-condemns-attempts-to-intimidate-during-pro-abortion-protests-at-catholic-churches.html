The protests at the Basilica of St. Patricks Old Cathedral, which have been occurring weekly and where a small number of anti-abortion activists worship, have been given added urgency by the recent leaked Supreme Court ruling on Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;<br><span class=copyright>(Stephanie Keith/Getty Images)</span></p><p>Pro-abortion protesters also marched to the homes of Supreme Court Justices John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh Saturday night for a “Candlelight vigil for Roe v.

Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, sent a letter Saturday to Attorney General Merrick Garland asking him to marshal resources necessary to protect churches under threat of vandalism and disruptive protest.</p><p>“We write to you today extremely concerned by multiple reports surfacing that left-wing activists intend to protest, and possibly disrupt, church services this weekend in direct response to the leaked opinion authored by Justice Alito that would overturn Roe v. Wade,” Lee and Roy wrote.</p><p>The lawmakers noted that a prominent example of anti-Christian vandalism has already been documented after Sacred Heart of Mary Catholic Church in Colorado was vandalized Wednesday with anti-religious and abortion-rights graffiti.</p><p><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></p><p>“Regardless of one’s position on abortion, the free exercise of religion is a core tenet of our Constitution,” Lee and Roy wrote. “We condemn behaviors that infringe upon the freedom to exercise one’s religious beliefs and respectfully ask that you swiftly alert and coordinate resources with state and local law enforcement to ensure that any organized effort across the country is properly addressed and the rights of Americans are protected.”</p><p><i>Fox News’ Timothy H.J.
