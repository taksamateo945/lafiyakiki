However, she is not keeping them from Pitt. A source shared with US Weekly the hostile exes have agreed to a healthy custody agreement regarding their kids, at least for the summer.</p><p>“The kids will be back and forth to Los Angeles to see Brad. Brad will also be spending time in New Mexico this summer because at times it will just be easier for him to go there,” the source explained the arrangement.</p><p>Another source shared that the Once Upon A Time In Hollywood star is happy with the current situation. Pitt is also reportedly thrilled that the animosity Jolie had toward him appears to have dwindled. He wants to spend as much time with his growing children as possible.</p><p>Maddox, age 17, Pax, age 15, Zahara, age 15, Shiloh, age 13, and twins Knox and Vivienne age 10 are all growing up fast. Although they have been spotted recently out with their mother in New Mexico, the source tells US Weekly Pitt is finally getting more time with his kids.</p><p></p><p>There was a time when the divorce between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt got so nasty it was affecting the amount of time he got to see the kids. Now that they have created a healthy custody arrangement for the summer, the doting dad is hopeful it can continue. After all, in a few short years, their babies will be all grown up.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Pitt and Jolie have put the past behind them as they each move forward with their lives. Both are busy working and raising their kids. Neither has embarked on a new romance since the split. However, they both became <a href=#>legally single</a> in April, a new relationship is not out of the question.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSp66lec%2Biq61lkaOxbq3NoJyloZ6Wequ7y6KcZqiclrtuv9SmpJ6qXZiyor%2FEZp2iqpVis7C%2BjK2fnmWjlrimec6fZKShlKh6tbTEsmSwoZyheqLA056kqaxdqbxur86pmKudnql6c4SYbnBpZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nilsa-prowant-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nilsa Prowant Net Worth: Her Husband, Age</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./channing-tatum-was-so-chill-about-nude-scene-with-sandra-bullock.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Channing Tatum was 'so chill' about nude scene with Sandra Bullock</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./day-life-pretty-little-liars-fan.html>A Day In The Life of a Pretty Little Liars fan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./thomas-joseph-big-heads-4-letters-crossword-clue-answers-1236577.html>Thomas Joseph Big heads 4 letters Crossword Clue Answers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities.html>Dina Manzo News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-hudgens-nude-picture-scandal-was-the-worst-moment-of-my-career-2013202.html>Vanessa Hudgens: Nude Picture Scandal Was the &amp;quot;Worst Moment of My Career&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-bogs-crossword-clue-answers-with-5-letters-1273267.html>LA Times Bogs Crossword Clue Answers with 5 letters</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZedJ.
