She revealed </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>on Instagram</span></a><span> that she has been working with personal trainers. </span><span>"For the last two to three months, 2-3 times a week [my personal trainers] have been running me into the ground, but in the most rewarding and beneficial way. I have hopefully gained some physical strength, but also [my trainers] have highlighted how important your mental well-being is to your overall health, which I think has been incredibly valuable."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_2294703083.jpg><p><span>Corey Mylchreest played the younger King George lll. He tells</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span> E! News</span></a><span> that he worked with a trainer to prep for the show. "We would start, and I would stop and think, 'I've had a really intense workout, and I won't need to come back for a few days,'" he said. "And then they would say, 'OK, halfway through the warmup.' It was just painful. It was just pain."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_2294702105.jpg><p><span>Golda Rosheuvel plays the older Queen Charlotte. She revealed her training process for the role to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Euphoria Magazine</span></a><span>. "During shooting and in my normal life, I work out three times a week. I do weight training, and about six weeks before filming, I'd start eating healthy and drinking lots of water because I have to be match fit because it takes a lot of stamina to wear those costumes and those wigs."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_2294702983.jpg><p><span>Arsema Thomas played the younger Agatha on the show. She talked about the positive response to the show to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Hollywood Reporter</span></a><span>. "</span><span>To see the positive response and the excitement and the applause from the Black community and really from everybody to this character and this story, I think is, unfortunately, the stamp of approval that the industry needs to show that these stories should be told. And you will still be successful in telling these stories — and that's successful in big ass quotes</span><span>."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/GettyImages-1803775681.jpg><p><span>Adjoa Antoh played the older Agatha on the series. She revealed to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Get The Gloss</span></a><span> that she loves spending time outside. "It's very grounding to see the ebb and flow of nature when you're going through something in your own body's cycle," Antoh says. "I've found it literally lowers the blood pressure, calms me and allows my eyes to rest in a wider vista away from the tiny screens we're fixed on for so much of the day now. My life has no routine so I just have to build it into my day wherever I'm working. I'll watch the sunrise, swim in the sea at any time of the year or go for a massive walk across the Sussex Downs, with a pair of binoculars, and do some birdwatching. I do it with my husband, too, which is a good way to be more alert to what's going on with each other and offer support."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_2294702685.jpg><p><span>Sam Clemmett played the role of young Brimsley. He also starred in </span><i><span>Harry Potter & The Cursed Child. </span></i><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>In a masterclass</span></a><span>, Clemmett revealed he had to stay in shape for the role. "It's a very demanding show and very physical. So every day would start with a warm up of things like yoga and cardio to make sure we had the stamina to perform in the shows and not injure ourselves."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_1073508791.jpg><p><span>Cyril Nri played Lord Herman Danbury. He talked about the importance of diversity in theater with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Fix Magazine.</span></a><span> "Some of this is about the economic constraints on black and ethnic minorities communities who have less disposable income to spend on such pursuits. But equally if there aren't real efforts made to have the people behind the scenes (directors, producers, writers) and onstage reflect your experience, why would a black audience get the catharsis that they seek from theatre?"</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKK5wLOgp59dl7yltcSsZKieXabCprHNZpqhmaKhvLXAxGaqrZmiqHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./charli-xcx-recruits-christine-and-the-queens-on-gone.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Charli XCX recruits Christine and the Queens on 'Gone'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ladd-drummond.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ladd Drummond Net Worth.
