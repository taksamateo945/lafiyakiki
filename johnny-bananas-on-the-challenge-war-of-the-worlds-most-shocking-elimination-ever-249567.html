In a new interview with Us Weekly, Bananas says that this upset is only going to help him in the future.</p><p>Bananas is not used to such an early elimination. During his 18 seasons, the only time he has left The Challenge earlier than week two was during his very first season – The Duel back in 2006 – when he was the first one to go home.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Two Champs who took the money for themselves. First two eliminated. Do you believe in curses? 🔮 <a href=# rel=nofollow>#TheChallenge33</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/p21NMhiYaF</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/L2fBTeM9CP</a></p><p>— The Challenge (@TheChallenge) <a href=# rel=nofollow>February 22, 2019</a></p><p>In War of the Worlds, Zach Nichols, one of Bananas’ closest allies, seemingly teamed up with Bananas’ rival Wes Bergmann. Even though Nichols denies working with Bergmann, he did help him win (even if it was a mistake) and Bananas was ultimately eliminated.</p><p>However, Bananas doesn’t buy Nichols’ story.</p><p>“Do not fall for Zach’s crocodile tears. He is very, very good. When you see a man of his stature start to cry, you’re like, ‘There’s no way this guy could be lying because there’s no one in their right mind able to do that.’ Zach’s able to do that … He was working with Wes the entire time,” says Bananas.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Did Bananas forget that Zach sent himself into an elimination last season so Bananas could stay in the game?? Doesn’t seem like a fake friend to me <a href=# rel=nofollow>#TheChallenge33</a></p><p>— Abby Zreliak (@abbyz51) <a href=# rel=nofollow>February 21, 2019</a></p><p>He added that Nichols never has important game conversations in front of the camera, so there is no video evidence that he worked with Bergmann. However, Bananas is certain that everything Nichols did was “100 percent intentional.”</p><p>Bananas also dished on his relationship with Nany, revealing that nothing happened romantically between them during War of the Worlds. However, he does like her as a friend, and she is “the realest person you’ll ever meet.”</p><p>The reality show legend also talked about the possibility of becoming The Bachelor, or as Bananas calls it “The Bananachelor.” He says that he would absolutely do the show, and if he brought home a nice girl, it would make his mom the happiest woman on Earth.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anyone who can watch this clip and honestly say Zach passing the ball to Wes was ACCIDENTAL, and they WEREN'T working together, is either in denial, delusional, dumb, or all three. <a href=# rel=nofollow>#TheChallenge33</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/1DTHCaf7PO</a></p><p>— Johnny Bananas (@johnnybananas) <a href=# rel=nofollow>February 22, 2019</a></p><p>Bananas says that The Bachelor has gotten so cookie cutter and vanilla, that it would be a nice change to have someone on the show who “knew how to be on TV.” And, being on the show would also give fans an opportunity to see a side of him they haven’t seen before.</p><p>He explained that the person he is on The Challenge is wearing a suit of armor and keeping people at a distance. And, Johnny Bananas says that the person he is in real life would never survive on The Challenge.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>New episodes of The Challenge: War of the Worlds air Wednesday nights on MTV.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeapLWvuthmmZqmkaOutHnOp2StoJVisKmty6Wcp5%2BVYsSivoyonWasmJp6uLvRpZusZZ2kwLV50qGmnKOZo7RuscuipKKmkam2sLqMnq2eql1ngXqBlXBm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./la-times-spot-for-a-donut-5-letters-crossword-clue-1243994.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>LA Times Spot for a donut 5 letters Crossword Clue</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mary-read.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Anne Bonny And Mary Read Changed The Face Of Piracy</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./day-life-pretty-little-liars-fan.html>A Day In The Life of a Pretty Little Liars fan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./thomas-joseph-big-heads-4-letters-crossword-clue-answers-1236577.html>Thomas Joseph Big heads 4 letters Crossword Clue Answers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities.html>Dina Manzo News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-hudgens-nude-picture-scandal-was-the-worst-moment-of-my-career-2013202.html>Vanessa Hudgens: Nude Picture Scandal Was the &amp;quot;Worst Moment of My Career&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-bogs-crossword-clue-answers-with-5-letters-1273267.html>LA Times Bogs Crossword Clue Answers with 5 letters</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZedJ.
