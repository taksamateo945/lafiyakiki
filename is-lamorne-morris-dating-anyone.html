YOU GUYS WOULD BE ADORABLE.” @cosmicalbabe, another user, expressed similar sentiments, writing, “all need to date irl already…”</p><p>But, despite their on-screen chemistry, the couple is not dating in real life. According to Cinemaholic, Morris answered the fans’ questions by emphasizing that he and Pedrad were simply friends.</p><p>Cinnaholic, on the other hand, provides no source or actual quotes from Morris to back up their claims. According to the website, Morris had reservations about relationships because of heartbreak caused by an ex-girlfriend who cheated on him. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the claim.</p><h2>Affair of Morris and Nasim Pedrad on Film</h2><p>Morris and Nasim Pedrad had fantastic on-screen chemistry, first in New Girl (2011) and then in Desperados (2012).

Following that, they fell in love, eventually marrying and having a child together in the show’s final season.</p><p>The actors’ character plots in Desperados were different but shared the same powerful chemistry. Pedrad portrayed a major character in the Netflix film, Wesley. The plot of the film starts when Pedrad’s character sends an angry email to her boyfriend, believing he has ghosted her. But he was recently involved in an accident in Mexico.</p><p>She travels to Mexico with her two best friends, fearful that the email will ruin her relationship. On the way, she runs into Morris’ character Sean, whom she had previously dated. Pedrad and Morris become entangled in their own private affairs on their journey to right her wrong.</p><h2 class=entry-title>Lamorne Morris: Ex-Girlfriend</h2><p>Morris never admitted to being in a relationship with Lim, but they were seen together a few times in public. They first sparked public interest in 2016 when Lim posted a photo of herself with Morris on her Twitter account. They also made their first red carpet appearance as a couple at the 2017 Emmys.</p><p>Lim was with Morris for a little more than two years before they split up. Lim is now married to Joshua Rhodes, the creative director of The Last Adam, a clothing brand.
