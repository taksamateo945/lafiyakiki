Former producer Steven Price says that when the dancing competition premieres later this year, it will feature at least one same-sex couple competing for the Mirror Ball Trophy.</p><p>“Because this day and age you cannot control love,” Price recently told The Sun. “You cannot control who or whom you love, so you have got to support it. You cannot condemn someone just because they love someone of the same sex. That is who they love — support it. As long as they are not hurting each other.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B5VqEjxhajA/</p><p>Price admitted that some viewers might not like the idea of same-sex couples competing on the show, but he said that the Midwest is changing their dynamic. He said that people are starting to be more open to it because they are being introduced to it, and ultimately “love is love” and the chemistry is the same.</p><p>Price added that adding same-sex couples to the cast brings a different twist to the show because that’s something that needs to be addressed and put out there. Host Tom Bergeron agrees that same-sex couples on DWTS are “overdue.”</p><p>The international versions of the show – like Strictly Come Dancing in the UK and Australia’s Dancing With the Stars – have already cast a same-sex couple. In Australia, the first same-sex couple competed last season, and Strictly Come Dancing will do the same in their upcoming season.</p><p>Of course, it’s too early to know who the show will cast for the upcoming season in America. But, ABC has met with Charlie Sheen as a possible contestant. Rob Mills, the senior VP of alternative series, specials, and late-night programming at ABC Entertainment, told Variety that he doesn’t think it’s a huge secret because Sheen talked about it. He added that he would love to see the actor join the cast next season.</p><p>https://twitter.com/AttitudeMag/status/1119911152870469633</p><p>Mills added that they would never say never to someone in politics. He pointed out that last season they cast former Donald Trump press secretary Sean Spicer, despite the controversy. He says that they would look at anyone who could potentially be good for the show.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>For the second year in a row Dancing With the Stars will only air in the fall, instead of airing two seasons per year in both the fall and spring. Bergeron – who was recently unmasked as the Taco on The Masked Singer – says that once a year is “right for now” because they’ve been on the air for 15 seasons and there is no need for over-saturation.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUrMG0edaio6VlmaOwrcHDnmSaZaOWuqZ50p6vZpufqr2tsYydrKuhnpx6tLHArKanZWJuerSt2Kxkn6eiorKzec%2Brpp2tk5q%2Fbn%2BWbm5wbl8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./174164-south-african-au-pair-teaches-toddler-funny-zulu-song-viral-tiktok-video-sa-amused.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>South African Au Pair Teaches US Toddler Funny Zulu Song in Viral TikTok Video, SA Amused</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ximena-saenz.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ximena Senz Age | Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Husband</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./day-life-pretty-little-liars-fan.html>A Day In The Life of a Pretty Little Liars fan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./thomas-joseph-big-heads-4-letters-crossword-clue-answers-1236577.html>Thomas Joseph Big heads 4 letters Crossword Clue Answers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities.html>Dina Manzo News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-hudgens-nude-picture-scandal-was-the-worst-moment-of-my-career-2013202.html>Vanessa Hudgens: Nude Picture Scandal Was the &amp;quot;Worst Moment of My Career&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-bogs-crossword-clue-answers-with-5-letters-1273267.html>LA Times Bogs Crossword Clue Answers with 5 letters</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZedJ.
