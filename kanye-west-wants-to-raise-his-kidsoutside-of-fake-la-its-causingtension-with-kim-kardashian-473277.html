This insider report comes amid speculations that the two live completely separate lives while their four young ones still live with their mom in L.A.</p><p>Does the rapper want to take the kids away from Kim and have them live with him?</p><p>This is what seems to be the case according to a new HollywoodLife source.</p><p>Apparently, the man has ‘plans’ for his ‘family to have a compound outside of L.A. in the desert somewhere.’</p><p>That’s right! The source told the news outlet that Kanye West thinks it would be much better for his and Kim’s four kids to grow up away from the city.</p><p>Of course, this has been causing even more tension between him and the KUWTK star than there was already.</p><p>The same source explained that ‘He’s absolutely done with living in L.A. and feels that everyone and everything’s fake. He does not want to bring his children up that way. He wants to build a compound in the desert. The geography of them as a family right now is a pretty large source of tension between them, but things are starting to get better as they start communicating.’</p><p>Kanye and Kim have been making headlines over their supposed marital problems, sources saying they live separate lives now.</p><p>But even amid such tensions, it still appears that divorce plans are not a priority.</p><p>Kim is apparently ready to make a compromise but she is definitely not OK with her kids moving to a compound in the desert, especially not without her and she has no intention of leaving ‘her home,’ L.A.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘This won’t affect their divorce because nothing has been decided or filed yet. Kim seems to be really patient right now because at the end of the day, she doesn’t want to split up the family and since the communication has improved, she’s waiting on him to shape up. She’d be open to having a compound as a place to visit, but not live full-time. She’s made it clear L.A. is her home.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeblru6sYywnKysXayur8DSZquoZaKWtrSxjKGgrGWbnrG0u9StqqKclWK8p3nFmqKeZZyWeqrA0maamq2jnruowMSnqqKnnmLEqsDHZqKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYoF4f5Fwbmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./netherlands-vs-ukraine-live-stream-free-tv-channel-score-euro-2020-latest-as-game-gets-off-to-fast-start.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Netherlands vs Ukraine LIVE: Stream FREE, TV channel, score Euro 2020 latest as game gets off to</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chinas-tiktok-sued-in-us-after-girls-die-choking-themselves-in-blackout-challenge.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>China's TikTok Sued In US After Girls Die Choking Themselves In 'Blackout Challenge'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./day-life-pretty-little-liars-fan.html>A Day In The Life of a Pretty Little Liars fan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./thomas-joseph-big-heads-4-letters-crossword-clue-answers-1236577.html>Thomas Joseph Big heads 4 letters Crossword Clue Answers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities.html>Dina Manzo News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-hudgens-nude-picture-scandal-was-the-worst-moment-of-my-career-2013202.html>Vanessa Hudgens: Nude Picture Scandal Was the &amp;quot;Worst Moment of My Career&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-bogs-crossword-clue-answers-with-5-letters-1273267.html>LA Times Bogs Crossword Clue Answers with 5 letters</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZedJ.
