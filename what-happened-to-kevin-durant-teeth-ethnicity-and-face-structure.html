The Untold Truth About Fousey Hair Tattoo, What Happened To His Head and Face?</strong></p><p>Yousef Saleh Erakat is an American citizen who was born on January 22 and hails from the city of Fremont in the state of California.</p><p>Erakat is a popular figure on social media and on YouTube. It was on March 21, 2011, that he created the YouTube channel known as “FouseyTube.” Although this channel is no longer his primary channel, it is still his online name. He is likely best recognised for this channel. There are currently more than 10 million customers who are subscribing to this service.</p><p>FouseyTube had published a wide variety of stuff into this channel and onto his two other channels. The majority of the content that he had uploaded focused on him reviewing various things, performing pranks, and engaging in challenges.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-57604 alt=Fouseytube width=225 height=225 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fouseytube-2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-57604 class=wp-caption-text>Fouseytube</p><h2><span id=Investigate_the_History_of_Fousey>Investigate the History of Fousey</span></h2><p>His Palestinian parents reared him, his older brothers Ahmad and Mohammad, and his older sister Noura in Fremont. Little is known about his parents since FouseyTube strives to safeguard their privacy. FouseyTube, Ahmad, and Mohammad FouseyTube.</p><p>FouseyTube is sensitive to the need for his Palestinian parents to maintain their privacy. His sister has become a prominent member of the community and an educator at a prestigious university.</p><p>After enrolling in a local high school, FouseyTube acquired a liking for athletics, and he went on to achieve enormous success in the sports of basketball and football even after graduating from high school.</p><p>Around the age of 16, he first became interested in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and working out. Before he started uploading videos to his channel on FouseyTube, he already had a number of other channels into which he was uploading videos concerning various aspects of physical fitness.</p><p>After receiving his diploma from high school in 2008, FouseyTube continued his education in the performing arts by enrolling at San Jose State University. In 2012, he completed the requirements for a bachelor’s degree. Following graduation, Fouseytube relocated to Los Angeles, California, with the goal of beginning a career in the entertainment industry. Despite this, he made the final decision to concentrate his career on YouTube instead.</p><h2><span id=The_Previously_Unknown_Facts_Concerning_Fousey_Hair_Tattoo_What_Occurred_to_His_Head_and_Face>The Previously Unknown Facts Concerning Fousey Hair Tattoo: What Occurred to His Head and Face</span></h2><p>The internet sensation discloses in one of his videos that he moved to Los Angeles in his early 20s and that is when he started to experience hair loss as a result of a genetic predisposition that is known as male pattern baldness. The condition is also known as androgenic alopecia.</p><p>In his videos, Fouseytube discusses how the experience of losing his hair was so difficult for him that it used to have an effect on his mood and it used to bind him up. He also claims that this uncertainty inhibited him from realising his full potential. [Citation needed] As a result of it, he was unable to take part in a great deal of life’s activities. He blames the medicine he was taking to manage his bipolar disorder for the quick worsening in the state of his thinning hair and argues that this was the cause of his hair loss.</p><p>He tried other styles, including completely shaving his head bald. Nonetheless, at this time, he also went through a phase in which he rapidly gained weight, which he now regards to be one of the most difficult phases of his life. In order to alter the image he projects to the world, he had a hair transplant performed by a professional in Los Angeles. The end result, in his opinion, was a complete and utter failure.</p><p>As a direct result of this, he wound up with ingrown hairs everywhere on his head. As a consequence, he not only suffered from thinning hair but also from ingrown hairs all over his body, in addition to the fact that he was overweight.</p><p>After that, he conducted experiments with a “hair replacement system,” which is a type of wig that is, at its core, a modification of the conventional toupee that takes into consideration contemporary fashion trends. Even while at first he liked how this made him appear, it did not take long for him to understand that the model he had selected required a great deal of maintenance.</p><p>After that, Fouseytube found out about micro scalp pigmentation, and they were immediately shocked by it. Nevertheless, he started to have second thoughts when he observed the aesthetician giving him a face glance at his head while she was working on him while she was working on him.</p><p>He alleges that she told him that she could make some modifications with some additional scalp tattooing, and he agreed to what ended out to be the most painful five hours of his life. He says that she claimed that she could make the alterations with some extra scalp tattooing. Even more worrisome is the fact that he asserts that she drew a new hairline for him that was wholly dissimilar to the one that he had previously, which made the situation even more difficult.</p><p>The YouTuber claimed that his first try at micropigmentation involved using inks that were specially mixed together and incredibly fine needles to generate very little dots that provided the effect of a shaved head. This was his first attempt at micropigmentation. According to him, the second procedure was more painful, and it seemed more like having a real tattoo. He observed that the dots were considerably more noticeable and that they had a uniform, monochromatic tone throughout the entire block.</p><p>In addition to this, he asserts that the current procedure was more agonising than the one before it. In his particular instance, black ink was used. As a consequence of this, there are a great number of tiny, thick black dots scattered all around the border of his hairline and in points across his head where the tattooist attempted to fill in other regions.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-57603 alt="Fouseytube's Hair Tattoo" width=300 height=169 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fouseytubes-Hair-Tattoo-300x169.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-57603 class=wp-caption-text>Fouseytube’s Hair Tattoo</p><h2><span id=Surgery_on_the_Fousey_and_Injuries_Sustained_While_Boxing>Surgery on the Fousey and Injuries Sustained While Boxing</span></h2><p>The user known as FouseyTube has recently uploaded a video to his channel on YouTube in which he discusses his recovery from a broken nose and the subsequent operation to restore it.</p><p>In 2019, Fousey competed in his first professional boxing match, which was against Slim Albaher, another content producer. Despite this, he was stopped in the fourth round of what was supposed to be a six-round fight. During the course of the demonstration match, Fousey sustained multiple injuries, one of which ultimately led to a fracture in his nose. He also appeared to be severely exhausted.</p><p>Because of the severity of the injury, it was necessary for him to have surgery. In spite of this, he is carrying on with his fighting career as though nothing had happened. The movie provides documentation of his significant injuries sustained during a boxing match as well as the early stages of the surgical recovery process.</p><p>The majority of the time, treating nose fractures requires performing a procedure known as a closed reduction of the nasal fractures. This is the technique that is always followed. This suggests that the bones and cartilage of the nose were repositioned in order to produce the best possible environment for the nose to heal in the shortest possible length of time. The overarching objective here is to facilitate the effective completion of the official nasal septal fracture repair that will take place at some point in the future.</p><p>For the majority of basic nasal fractures, a fracture of the nasal septum that was repaired with a closed reduction provides sufficient treatment. On the other hand, when circumstances are similar to this one, the nasal bones and the septum have a tendency to collapse over time, resulting in a deformity known as a saddle nose. As a direct consequence of this, it will be necessary to do somewhat more extensive reconstruction, which will also involve the requirement of a rib cartilage graft. The fact that Fousey’s cartilage in his nose has been destroyed is not something to be taken lightly.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-57602 alt=Fouseytube width=183 height=275 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fouseytube-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-57602 class=wp-caption-text>Fouseytube</p><h2 class=headline><span id=fouseyTUBE_Trivia><b>fouseyTUBE Trivia</b></span></h2><ul><li>fouseyTUBE was born in Fremont, United States.</li><li>fouseyTUBE’s birth sign is Aquarius.</li><li>In 2017 he created a secondary channel called The Kats Family, which surpassed half a million subscribers within the first year it was created.&nbsp;He was named Entertainer of the Year at the 2016 Streamy Awards.</li><li>He has a sister named&nbsp;Noura.
