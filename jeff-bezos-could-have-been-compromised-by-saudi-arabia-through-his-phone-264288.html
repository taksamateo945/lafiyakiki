As of today, it is unclear to what degree, if any, AMI was aware of the details.”</p><p>Saudi Arabia’s minister of state for foreign affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, previously reacted to the accusations by saying: “This is something between the two parties, we have nothing to do with it. It sounds to me like a soap opera. Maybe some of our citizens read The National Enquirer when they’re in the United States… but that’s it.”</p><p>It is not known how the personal device of someone in the position of Mr. Bezos could have been compromised.</p><p>The announcement was met with worried responses by certain groups and has introduced yet another reason for people to doubt the security of the phones in their pockets.</p><p>Many people have recently started to move away from smartphones as a whole, claiming that the intrusions into their privacy have become too much to bear.</p><p>Whether this could have any further impact on the business of Amazon itself is hard to tell.</p><p>Bezos has not offered any additional comments on the situation with his device’s security.</p><p>However, this is expected given the sensitive nature of the incident and the fact that a confirmation of the hack could lead to even more potential leaks in the near future.</p><p>The Saudi Arabia angle is reportedly linked to the Bezos’ owned-news outlet, Washington Post‘s coverage of the Jamal Khashoggi killing that rocked the country.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Do you think this could be a problem for Amazon?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeamrOnecGesairXZi8trjDZp%2BarpVir6axzWaaqKWgp7yutdKem2aaqWLAosHDomSaqpGXtqJ506GpqK2XnXqptdJmp6Gnnpp6c4KTa29xZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jimmy-iovine-daughter-jessica-iovine.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jimmy Iovine with his daughter</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./35351-20-hottest-women-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>20 of the hottest women in the world</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./day-life-pretty-little-liars-fan.html>A Day In The Life of a Pretty Little Liars fan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./thomas-joseph-big-heads-4-letters-crossword-clue-answers-1236577.html>Thomas Joseph Big heads 4 letters Crossword Clue Answers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities.html>Dina Manzo News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-hudgens-nude-picture-scandal-was-the-worst-moment-of-my-career-2013202.html>Vanessa Hudgens: Nude Picture Scandal Was the &amp;quot;Worst Moment of My Career&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-bogs-crossword-clue-answers-with-5-letters-1273267.html>LA Times Bogs Crossword Clue Answers with 5 letters</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZedJ.
