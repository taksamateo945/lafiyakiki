Their asking price was probably too high initially, and then when they realized the seats got filled, they had to lower their ask. I don't understand why you would make that trade because if somebody has an injury or doesn't get the quarterback they thought they were going to get, the ask will be higher."</i></p><p>It was widely expected that Fields would be traded this offseason since the Bears have the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft and the opportunity to select USC quarterback Caleb Williams, but few could have envisioned the Bears getting so little in return.</p><p>The Steelers only had to send the Bears a conditional 2025 sixth-round pick that can become a fourth-round pick if Fields plays at least 51 percent of the team's offensive snaps in 2024.</p><p>Given that Pittsburgh signed veteran Russell Wilson to be the starting quarterback, the conditions are unlikely to be met unless Wilson gets injured.</p><p>It is unclear exactly what the Bears were seeking in exchange for Fields early in the offseason, but ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Jeremy Fowler</a> reported in January that league evaluators placed his value at a second- or third-round pick in an informal league poll.</p><p>The Bears ultimately didn't get anything close to that, and it may be because they waited too long.</p><p>By the time Chicago finally dealt Fields, most teams had already addressed their quarterback needs via free agency or clearly intended to do so early in the draft.</p><p>It was widely assumed a team would part with a Day 2 draft pick to bring in the 25-year-old Fields and give him a chance to start in 2024, but he is a clear backup for the Steelers, and they got him for a bargain price.</p><p>The Bears could have waited longer and hoped for a desperate team to up their offer, but it is likely that they wanted to avoid any awkwardness with Fields and the No. 1 overall pick being on the roster at the same time.</p><p>Chicago probably wants to make it clear to Williams or whoever it picks that they are the franchise quarterback, and the Bears were willing to take less for Fields in order to make that happen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWqBcn2Mp52lZZWtsqR5wZ6Yq6tdnLy1ecGuo6WhlZl6sL6MoJivnV2qvW7DyK2fZqKlqMGquoyfoJ6klKh6tb7AnZxmrJ9iwLWxxKWcq6s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-guess-i-you-an-apology-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I guess I ___ you an apology</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mani-woman-vest-costume.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Greek Costume Mani Woman Vest Blessed Celebration</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./day-life-pretty-little-liars-fan.html>A Day In The Life of a Pretty Little Liars fan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./thomas-joseph-big-heads-4-letters-crossword-clue-answers-1236577.html>Thomas Joseph Big heads 4 letters Crossword Clue Answers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities.html>Dina Manzo News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-hudgens-nude-picture-scandal-was-the-worst-moment-of-my-career-2013202.html>Vanessa Hudgens: Nude Picture Scandal Was the &amp;quot;Worst Moment of My Career&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-bogs-crossword-clue-answers-with-5-letters-1273267.html>LA Times Bogs Crossword Clue Answers with 5 letters</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZedJ.
