In June, a federal grand jury impaneled by Smith <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>issued a 37-count indictment</a> for willful retention of national defense information and conspiring to obstruct justice, among several other crimes, relating to his alleged mishandling of classified documents at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, while no longer president.</p><p>And in Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>has suggested</a> that <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>indictments relating to</a> Trump’s 2020 election interference in that state could come before September. On Monday, the state Supreme Court <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>unanimously agreed</a> to toss Trump’s bid to quash her investigation.</p><p>In light of “all these never-ending attacks,” as Hannity phrased it, “it doesn’t seem to bother you like I think it would bother so many other people. What is it about you that it doesn’t?”</p><p>Trump, though, didn’t quite go along with the Fox host’s view of the situation.</p><p>“No, it bothers me. It bothers me for everybody in this incredible sold-out audience,” he said to those gathered in Des Moines.</p><p>Trump then regurgitated his complaint that the investigations into him are “election interference,” and that the Department of Justice is partisan.</p><p>“They want to try to demean and diminish and frighten people,” he insisted. “But they don’t frighten us because we’re going to make America great again. That’s all there is.”</p><p>Hannity dutifully replied that he has never felt “more fearful of the state of this country than I am right now.”</p><p>Minutes later, Hannity—<a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>in classic</a> <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Fox fashion</a>—attempted a clunky transition from Trump’s legal woes to Hunter Biden.</p><p>“We cannot ignore today’s events, when you put out your Truth Social posts,” Hannity said.</p><p>“By that, I want to talk about what is clearly now what the Judiciary Committee under Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) is looking into: whether or not our FBI and our Department of Justice have been weaponized and politicized,” he said. “I have two headlines here: ‘FBI tipped off Biden team, Secret Service about plan to interview Hunter.’”</p><p>Shortly after, Hannity name dropped none other than Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Hannity, of course, <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>denigrated</a> the work of the House Jan. 6 Committee, which ultimately <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>made four criminal referrals</a> of Trump to the DOJ, two of which were for <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>obstructing</a> an official proceeding and <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>defrauding</a> the government by committing a conspiracy.</p><p>It remains to be seen which crime or crimes Trump will be charged with as a result of his attempts to cling to power after losing the 2020 presidential election.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnlqTFbrrEsKpmmZ6YtbC%2B0magp66ZqbJuwNGupKllpKR6pK3LpWSipl2Ws7Wx0Waemqqclrulec%2BrnKyrlad8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carly-pearce-to-host-15th-annual-acm-honors-this-august.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Carly Pearce to Host 15th Annual ACM Honors this August Celeb Secrets Country</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jenny-han.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jenny Han- Wiki, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./day-life-pretty-little-liars-fan.html>A Day In The Life of a Pretty Little Liars fan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./thomas-joseph-big-heads-4-letters-crossword-clue-answers-1236577.html>Thomas Joseph Big heads 4 letters Crossword Clue Answers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities.html>Dina Manzo News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-hudgens-nude-picture-scandal-was-the-worst-moment-of-my-career-2013202.html>Vanessa Hudgens: Nude Picture Scandal Was the &amp;quot;Worst Moment of My Career&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-bogs-crossword-clue-answers-with-5-letters-1273267.html>LA Times Bogs Crossword Clue Answers with 5 letters</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZedJ.
