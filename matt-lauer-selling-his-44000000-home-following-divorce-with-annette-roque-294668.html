Sources who spoke with the outlet claimed they are about to put the home up on the market.</p><p>Matt and Anne first bought the house from the Hollywood actor, Richard Gere, for $36.5 million in 2016. Susan Breitenbach, for Corcoran, said the house at the time was perfect for the television host and his partner. A broker said drones have been circling it from above and on the ground as well.</p><p>Reportedly, the gated home sits on 6.2 landscaped acres with three-hundred feet on the ocean. The 12-bedroom, 12 bathroom house goes all the way back to 1902, but it has been remodeled and restored to what insiders call “eco-chic.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BmgdNFVgrx1/</p><p>When the house was first on the market in 2013, it was listed for a whopping $65 million. Insiders claim Roque has intentions to stay in the Hamptons with her kids, while Matt will have to go out and get his very own place.</p><p>Reportedly, Anne will receive approximately $20,000,000 in assets from the divorce, and she also gets to keep their 40-acre horse farm in Water Mill of the Hamptons. They bought the house, called Bright Side Farm now, for $3.5 million in 2012.</p><p>The outlet previously reported that the couple just finished the final part of their divorce and now it will be finalized by a judge. Back in 2017, Matt was relieved from his duties at NBC following several misconduct allegations against him.</p><p>Fans of Today noticed that Matt wasn’t featured in the 25-anniversary video this past Thursday. Ever since Matt was accused of sexual misconduct at the height of the #MeToo movement in 2017, he has, for the most part, managed to stay out of the public’s eye.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Formerly, there were rumors that Matt was getting a job over at CNN, however, the boss later came out and said there was no chance Matt would be working there.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedlsG1ecuarJ6qXaiyrbjIp55moJmoenWAj2lnaWhgYrWwucRmnaiknKTEqrrGZpuirp%2BnsKZ51qKroWWRo7umwNOeZKunoaqybn6YbW1vcF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kevin-mccarthy-california-politician.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kevin McCarthy Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mario-selman-gay-net-worth-age-wiki-bio.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Mario Selman Gay?
