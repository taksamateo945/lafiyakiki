However, as she faces an unexpected health issue, she will have to shift all her focus. Will there be enough Sheree to go around?”&nbsp;</p><p>Fans were introduced to Whitfield and her son during the first season of “RHOA” back in 2008. Throughout his appearances, viewers watch Kairo finish high school and go off to attend the historically Black men’s institution Morehouse College.</p><p>As news about Whitefield’s status as a ‘Glamma,’ fans mentioned her beau Martell Holt and what she’s preparing to go through this season.</p><p>“Not this write up putting “stepping into greatness” and “suffering public humiliation” in one sentence to describe my girl Shereé and KAIRO HAD A BABY?! also sighhh not this Martell Holt guy — I read up on him and I’m scared for Shereé. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">#rhoa</a>.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not this write up putting “stepping into greatness” and “suffering public humiliation” in one sentence to describe my girl Shereé 😭 and KAIRO HAD A BABY?! 😯 also sighhh not this Martell Holt guy — I read up on him and I’m scared for Shereé. <a href=#>#rhoa</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/jIl1BNQbCA</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mxATesKDex</a></p>— Daily Bravo 💌 (@dailybravomail) <a href=#>March 31, 2023</a></figure><p>Another <a href=#>said</a>, “Kairo had a baby?? i feel so old but i know sheree will be motheringg this season.”</p><p>One of the most memorable on-screen moments with Kairo and his mother happened during the show’s ninth season. In one episode, the two had a discussion about the then 19-year-old after he was arrested for a DUI.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked to explain himself, Kairo admitted that he smoked pot earlier that day, but wasn’t under the influence while he was driving.&nbsp;</p><p>“He pulled me over for an expired tag, not for driving reckless or anything,” he said. “Then he pulled me out the car, he didn’t find anything in there.”</p><p>During their conversation, Whitfield became emotional as she expressed to her child how scared she was after receiving the phone call that her Black son had been taken into police custody.&nbsp;</p><p>“Anything could happen,” she told him. “And this is something you have to put in your head that as a Black young man, you’re not on the same playing field as a lot of people. And that’s the f—-d up part about it.”</p><p>Kairo graduated from Morehouse College in 2020 and reportedly worked with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyler Perry</a> during season 14 of the show.</p><p>In addition to Kairo, Whitfield also has a 30-something-year-old daughter named Tierra Fuller, and a 24-year-old daughter, Kaleigh Whitfield.</p><p>Season 15 of “RHOA” returns on May 7 on Bravo.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49tZmlrX6i1pr7EnmSwoJmps6qxy51koqtdpLOntcKimKWkqWKubrPLmqSmmV2Ws7Wx0WaqqKZdoK6qvs5mmZ6bn6KytHnAZp2arJiav26%2FwLKqZqqVpcBustGopGaaopbDsHnTr2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./know-about-amanda-seyfried-movies-age-baby-husband-height-child.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Know About Amanda Seyfried; Movies, Age, Baby, Husband, Height, Child</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./t-bonz-brand-nyt-crossword-clue-1104755.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>T-Bonz brand NYT Crossword Clue</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./day-life-pretty-little-liars-fan.html>A Day In The Life of a Pretty Little Liars fan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./thomas-joseph-big-heads-4-letters-crossword-clue-answers-1236577.html>Thomas Joseph Big heads 4 letters Crossword Clue Answers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities.html>Dina Manzo News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-hudgens-nude-picture-scandal-was-the-worst-moment-of-my-career-2013202.html>Vanessa Hudgens: Nude Picture Scandal Was the &amp;quot;Worst Moment of My Career&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-bogs-crossword-clue-answers-with-5-letters-1273267.html>LA Times Bogs Crossword Clue Answers with 5 letters</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZedJ.
