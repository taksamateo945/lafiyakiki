"Masterful." &lt;a href="https://t.co/cCOosU0van">pic.twitter.com/cCOosU0van&lt;/a></p><p>It was yet another head-turning showing for the 39-year-old playing in his 21st season.</p><p>Fans should also make sure they appreciate him while he's still stuffing stat sheets, as he <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a> "not very long" when asked how long he's going to play. "I'm not gonna play another 21 years, that's for damn sure. But not very long. I don't know when that door will close as far as when I'll retire. But I don't have much time left."</p><p>There were times earlier in the King's career where three-point shooting was something of a weakness, at least compared to how excellent he did almost everything else on the court.</p><p>However, that is no longer the case as he ages.</p><p>James is shooting 40.1 percent from three-point range this season, which underscores just how difficult he is to stop even at this stage. He can still overpower his way to the rim and through the lane, and shooting like he has means defenders can't simply sag off him to create space.</p><p>The Lakers as a whole are also starting to round into form with wins in six of their last seven games, which has propelled them to 1.5 games ahead of the Golden State Warriors for ninth place in the Western Conference and one game behind the Sacramento Kings for the eighth spot.</p><p>Reaching eighth would be important, as the Nos. 7 and 8 seeds face off in the play-in tournament in a non-elimination game. By contrast, the Nos. 9 and 10 seeds face each other in an elimination game.</p><p>As long as James continues to shoot like he did Sunday, the Lakers will have a chance against anyone come play-in and playoff time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWp%2BdIOMpZiknaKoeqK606Gmp7Fdma63tdJmo56aoqS7brbAppysZaeWwG65wKyrnqqWqrluucCkoKefXW56tbTRnpxmqJ%2Beu7Wx0axkr6tdo7K1vw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./no-merci-lyrics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>No Merci Lyrics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./166331-all-architect-salaries-south-africa-month.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>All about architect salaries per month in South Africa in 2023</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./day-life-pretty-little-liars-fan.html>A Day In The Life of a Pretty Little Liars fan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./thomas-joseph-big-heads-4-letters-crossword-clue-answers-1236577.html>Thomas Joseph Big heads 4 letters Crossword Clue Answers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities.html>Dina Manzo News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-hudgens-nude-picture-scandal-was-the-worst-moment-of-my-career-2013202.html>Vanessa Hudgens: Nude Picture Scandal Was the &amp;quot;Worst Moment of My Career&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-bogs-crossword-clue-answers-with-5-letters-1273267.html>LA Times Bogs Crossword Clue Answers with 5 letters</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZedJ.
