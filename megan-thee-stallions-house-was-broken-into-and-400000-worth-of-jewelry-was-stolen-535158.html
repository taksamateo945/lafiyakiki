The local police have not managed to narrow down any suspects at the moment but law enforcement agents are working hard to determine the identity of the robbers.</p><p>Thankfully, the WAP rapper was not in her home at the time of the break-in as she was in New York, where she is preparing for her appearance on Saturday Night Live where she will be serving as both the host of the show and as the special musical guest, which rarely ever happens and makes Megan’s task all the more demanding.</p><p>Megan did take to Twitter to share her thoughts on the matter. At first, the rapper simply tweeted, “wow,” but she followed it up with a more comprehensive thought, stating, &nbsp;“Material things can be replaced but I’m glad everyone is safe 💙🙏🏾”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Material things can be replaced but I’m glad everyone is safe 💙🙏🏾</p><p>— TINA SNOW (@theestallion) <a href=# rel=nofollow>October 14, 2022</a></p><p>Clearly, the rapper has her eyes on the more important things in life and her fans are glad to hear it.</p><p>Speaking of the more important things in life, the rapper has also announced that after her appearance on Saturday Night Live, she will be taking a little break from the world of entertainment. She tweeted this decision in the following words:</p><p>“Hotties im really sorry but after SNL I really gotta take a break I’m so tired, physically and emotionally.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hotties im really sorry but after SNL I really gotta take a break I’m so tired, physically and emotionally</p><p>— TINA SNOW (@theestallion) <a href=# rel=nofollow>October 14, 2022</a></p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Regardless of whether this decision is motivated by the break-in at her house or from her generally full daily to-do list, Megan is going to be taking a break. With the rapper being everywhere, from music to Marvel to Saturday Night Live, it’s safe to say she has earned a leave of absence.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedmrSiuoytn56dXajBorjLoqanq12dvLa%2FxGaumqtdl7%2Bwt8SnZKKmpKR6orrDZmtpaGBlfW7DzquroWWfm3qrsdaeo6uxXayutHnSraalnZ5ignSBkG5vaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amine-gulse.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Amine Gulse- Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Career, Nationality</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lea-michele-releases-album-places.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lea Michele releases sophomore album 'Places'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./day-life-pretty-little-liars-fan.html>A Day In The Life of a Pretty Little Liars fan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./thomas-joseph-big-heads-4-letters-crossword-clue-answers-1236577.html>Thomas Joseph Big heads 4 letters Crossword Clue Answers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities.html>Dina Manzo News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-hudgens-nude-picture-scandal-was-the-worst-moment-of-my-career-2013202.html>Vanessa Hudgens: Nude Picture Scandal Was the &amp;quot;Worst Moment of My Career&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-bogs-crossword-clue-answers-with-5-letters-1273267.html>LA Times Bogs Crossword Clue Answers with 5 letters</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZedJ.
