The Australian actress revealed in a new interview with <a href=#>DuJour magazine</a> that she keeps in touch with them via text.</p><p>“I have four children, so to stay in touch with them it’s very important,” Kidman, 48, explained. “I’m definitely engaged in it but I don’t let it rule my life.” (Kidman also shares daughters <strong>Sunday Rose</strong>, 7, and <strong>Faith Margaret</strong>, 4, with husband <a href=#><strong>Keith Urban</strong></a>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Kidman and <a href=#><strong>Tom Cruise</strong></a>, 53, adopted Bella, 22, and Connor, 20, after marrying in 1990. The couple split in 2000. Back in March, Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief director <strong>Alex Gibney </strong>insinuated that the Church of Scientology turned Connor and Bella against Kidman, <a href=#>which the church denied.</a></p><p>“I’ve chosen not to speak publicly about Scientology. I have two children who are Scientologists—Connor and Isabella—and I utterly respect their beliefs,” Kidman told <a href=#>Vanity Fair in 2013.</a></p><p>“They are generous, kind and hardworking. And these are traits that I love to see in my children,” she added to Women’s Weekly in May 2014. “They live with Tom, which was their choice. I’d love them to live with us, but what can you do?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Kidman may text her kids, but she definitely doesn’t send “heart” emojis to Urban, 47. The Lion actress revealed to DuJour that the pair are a bit more old school when they keep in touch.</p><p>“My husband and I never text each other. We never do. Once in a blue moon, we’ll text. But mainly we say, ‘I want to hear your voice,'” she told the mag. “That’s very unusual but we’ve been together for 10 years. We started like that and we haven’t changed it. We don’t email each other either. So it’s about trying to keep it as intimate and personal as possible.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And that they do. Kidman and the country singer try their best to see each other despite their busy schedules. “I’m lucky that we have such a strong family unit. I have an incredible husband who is so willing to get on planes and fly places, even if it’s for a night,” Kidman explained. “I had an opening of the play [Photograph 51] three nights ago, and he’s in the middle of a tour in the States. I said, ‘It’s too much for you to have to fly all the way back, don’t worry,’ and he said, ‘I’m flying.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>She gushed: “He flew 10 hours to come and be with me for the night, and then he flew back and did a gig. That for me is love in action. That’s extraordinary. But I would do the same for him and that’s what we’ve committed to as a couple.”</p><p>Kidman is also committed to taking some “me” time. In fact, she enjoys meditating and daydreaming to avoid any type of stress. “With an hour free, it depends. I love getting down on the floor and playing with my kids. I read an article that says it’s so important to actually get down on their level and play with them for an hour a day. So I do that, and I love that. It brings back the child in me,” she said of her free time. “If I was in Sydney, I love the beach. Even though I’m incredibly pale, I put on these terribly long unattractive rashies, and people laugh at me. My kids laugh at me. But that’s what I would do.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKWim5%2Bhsm63yJ2kmqZdnnqlscWipaKslaHGbsDEsatmr5mptW6vzqelqKpdlrulecGeo6WZXZi%2FtrXSnmRmamBmgnN%2BmA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fate-grail.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>This Is How To Download Fate Grail Apk File; League April Fools 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dyler.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dyler [Youtuber] Wiki, Net Worth, Height, Age &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./day-life-pretty-little-liars-fan.html>A Day In The Life of a Pretty Little Liars fan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./thomas-joseph-big-heads-4-letters-crossword-clue-answers-1236577.html>Thomas Joseph Big heads 4 letters Crossword Clue Answers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities.html>Dina Manzo News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-hudgens-nude-picture-scandal-was-the-worst-moment-of-my-career-2013202.html>Vanessa Hudgens: Nude Picture Scandal Was the &amp;quot;Worst Moment of My Career&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-bogs-crossword-clue-answers-with-5-letters-1273267.html>LA Times Bogs Crossword Clue Answers with 5 letters</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZedJ.
