This all comes after the news of Simon’s supposed speedy recovery which was suggested by his AGT co-star, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howie Mandel</a>.</p><p>Back in August, Howie said Simon was on the mend and would be back on the show in no time. Moreover, he said Simon was already walking around and would likely be coming back on the popular reality television series sometime soon.</p><p>Rumor has it that Cowell will be out of commission for the next half a year, possibly even more. Moreover, sources state he is in a lot of pain at the moment, and won’t even record messages for America’s Got Talent from his home.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CDe8p70j8dQ/</p><p>A friend who spoke with The Sun claimed it’s been rough for Simon over the last few weeks. The insider described him as “fairly gung-ho,” and a “fighter,” but there’s no question <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cowell</a> is struggling despite his tough-guy demeanor.</p><p>Currently, Simon’s girlfriend and the mother of his 6-year-old child, Lauren Silverman, is taking care of his home in Malibu, California. Initially, Cowell had thought about taping messages for America’s Got Talent, however, the media personality has since changed his mind.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>On the other hand, sources have stated Simon is still making the best of it, and he’s in “decent spirits.” As it was previously reported, Simon broke his back while he was testing out an E-bike in front of his kids.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejnrqwuoycprCdnKF6uLXLpWSrnaCkv7Wxw6WwZqSRrnqquoybnJ1llqS%2FbsDHnmSnnaipend5zKilraCjYrOwuMuorqKml2K1qr%2BMp5yco12eu6vB0bJkbWxka4Z0ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jack-wagner-speaks-out-after-his-sons-heartbreaking-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jack Wagner Speaks Out After His Son's Heartbreaking Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jason-derulo-says-the-quarantine-lockdown-changed-everything-for-his-career-451731.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Derulo Says The Quarantine Lockdown Changed Everything For His Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./day-life-pretty-little-liars-fan.html>A Day In The Life of a Pretty Little Liars fan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./thomas-joseph-big-heads-4-letters-crossword-clue-answers-1236577.html>Thomas Joseph Big heads 4 letters Crossword Clue Answers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities.html>Dina Manzo News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-hudgens-nude-picture-scandal-was-the-worst-moment-of-my-career-2013202.html>Vanessa Hudgens: Nude Picture Scandal Was the &amp;quot;Worst Moment of My Career&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-bogs-crossword-clue-answers-with-5-letters-1273267.html>LA Times Bogs Crossword Clue Answers with 5 letters</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZedJ.
