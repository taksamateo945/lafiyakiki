Her actual birthday is not known to the public. However, we can confirm that she was born in the city of Los Angeles, California to Bert Kreischer and his wife LeeAnn Kreischer. Her parents named her after her mother’s native land, Georgia</p><p>Georgia comes from a mixed background but the full details have not been made public. However, she is an American by nationality as she was born in the United States. She also grew up in California which is her place of birth. Georgia grew up with a sister named Ila Kreischer with whom she shares a very close bond.</p><h2><strong>Georgia Kreischer’s College Education</strong></h2><p>Georgia is still studying and should be in college now, but the name of the institution she is enrolled in is not public knowledge. According to reports, she attended a private school in California for high school and graduated with flying colors. Though Bert and LeeAnn are active in the media space, they value their family’s privacy and protect their children from the prying eyes of the public.</p><h2><strong>What Does She Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>Georgia Kreischer is currently a student who just finished high school in 2022. At 19 years of age, she is still enjoying living with her parents and is focused on getting her education to the highest level.</p><p>Despite not being identified in any career field, Georgia lives with celebrity parents who have often carried her along. She has made a few appearances in her parents’ podcast and has impressed fans tremendously. She and her sister have also formed part of the content her parents dish out during their routine.</p><p>There is therefore that possibility that Georgia Kreischer may end up following her parent’s footsteps into entertainment. She could end up as a comedian and podcaster like her dad. She could also become a thespian like her mom. Then again, she may venture far away from showbiz as we have seen some celebrity kids do.</p><h2><strong>Are Georgia Kreischer’s Parents, Bert, and LeeAnn Still Together?</strong></h2><p>Georgia Kreischer’s parents, Bert and LeeAnn are still together and their love story is one that is deserving of a rom-com treatment. When they first met, Bert immediately picked interest in LeeAnn and wanted a relationship with her, but the gesture was not reciprocated. Their first meeting didn’t go so well apparently and the second was not any different. LeAnn continued giving Bert the cold shoulder but fate had other plans for the two.</p><p>The third time was the charm for the couple as LeeAnn started warming up to Bert. This time, they met at a bowling center and exchanged numbers. However, they didn’t communicate for a while and interestingly, it was LeeAnn who reached out to Bert first. He hadn’t rushed to contact her after getting her number, thus, she decided to give him a call and they started seeing each other. The couple dated for a while before getting married in December 2003.</p><p>Georgia Kreischer’s parents have enjoyed their marital bliss for about two decades and nothing seems to come between them. They are one of those celebrity couples who have found a way to balance their busy career with family life. Both Bert and LeeAnn are media personalities. They have worked on different projects individually and as co-anchors.</p><h2><strong>Georgia Kreischer Has a Younger Sister named Ila</strong></h2><p>Georgia Kreischer has a younger sister named Ila Kreischer, who was born in 2007. Ila is her only sibling and just like Georgia, Ila’s exact date of birth is not known.</p><p>The sisters share a very close bond and live with their parents. Ila Kreischer has not shown any interest in any career path, however, she still has years ahead of her and enough time to make up her mind.</p><h2><b>She is not Active on Social Media Unlike her Parents&nbsp;</b></h2><p>Ila is not active on any social media platform yet and the Instagram account in Georgia’s name is not open to the public. The IG handle which is set to private has more than 673k followers and 11 posts.</p><p>Georgia’s parents on the other hand have quite a number of followers across different social media platforms. Her mom, LeeAnn is very active on Instagram with 130k followers where she shares work-related posts and family time with her daughters.</p><p>Georgia’s dad is the celebrity in the family with over 2.4 million Instagram followers. Most of his posts feature him shirtless. The American comedian has won many hearts with his funny jokes and shows. He is also active on other social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, and runs a self-titled YouTube channel with more than 1 million subscribers.</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h3><strong>Who are Bert Kreischer’s kids?</strong></h3><p>Bert Kreischer’s kids are his daughters Georgia Kreischer and Ila Kreischer, whom he had with his wife, LeeAnn.
